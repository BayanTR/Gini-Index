#Gini-Index
One of the most challenges facing the decision tree is determining the most appropriate variable to be the decision tree node, and this is called the feature selection process, and we distinguish from it a genetic scale that works with the targeted target variable "success" or "failure". It only performs binary divisions, and the higher the genetic value, the greater the homogeneity of the data.
